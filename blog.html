            expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the
            master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or

            who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter
            consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone
            who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it
            is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil

            annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no
